## Introduction
Learning how to explore data and tell stories using ggplot2.

Load packages:
```{r Package Loading}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(ggrepel)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(plotly)
```

Load data for data visualization:
```{r Loading Data}
dogs <- read_csv(file = "data/dogs.csv")

nrow(dogs)
ncol(dogs)
names(dogs)
head(dogs)
tail(dogs)
summary(dogs)
class(dogs$aod)
class(dogs$height)
class(dogs$weight)
class(dogs$shortcoat)

unique(dogs$shortcoat)
```

Starting to plot data:
```{r Plotting}
plot(dogs$weight, dogs$aod)
#It appears that smaller dogs tend to live longer than larger dogs.

p1 <- ggplot(dogs, aes_string(x = "weight", y = "aod")) #generate plotting object
p1 <- ggplot_add(geom_point(), p1) #Adds points to p1
##p1 #Shows plot

#You can add multiple layers with a single call of ggplot using "+"
p1 <- ggplot(dogs, aes_string(x = "weight", y = "aod")) + 
  geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,160,40)) +
  labs(x = "body weight (lbs)", y = "longevity (years)", title = "Longevity of dogs versus weight") + theme_cowplot()
p1
```
