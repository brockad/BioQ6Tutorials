## Introduction
Load Packages:
```{r Package loading}
library(tidyverse)
library(qvalue)
```


Sample code from tutorial:
```{r Sample}
#Example code
#read the Dataset sheet into “R”. The dataset will be called "data".
data <- read.csv("https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/covid19/casedistribution/csv", 
                 na.strings = "", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")
# the code below shows how you may recode the country name's 
# first letter to a numeric alphabetic position.
data1 <- data[(data$dateRep=="11/08/2020"), ]  
CountryAb <- as.integer(as.factor(substr(data1$countriesAndTerritories,1,1)))
# build a linear model for the relationship between 
# Cumulative_number_for_14_days_of_COVID.19_cases_per_100000 and 
# the alphabetic position of country name's first letter.
model1<- lm(Cumulative_number_for_14_days_of_COVID.19_cases_per_100000~CountryAb, 
            data=data1)
summary(model1)
# On 8/11/2020, we did not find a significant relationship 
# between alphabetic order of country name and COVID-19 cases. 
# But what if we keep looking at other dates? 
```

Suggestions for p-hacking:\
log transformations, narrowing dates, looking at subgroups ("green jelly bean")\

Attempts:
```{r Inadvertent p-hacking challenge}
#Let's transform to a tible for some tidyverse functionalities
data <- as_tibble(data)
```
